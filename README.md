# Project React Native App 📱

The aim was to build a mobile app using React Native and styled components. I choose to do a simple quote generator that would generate affirmations quotes every time the phone was being shaked. This was done by using an accelerometer that detects when the phone was being shaked.

## The process and the achieved results 👩‍💻

This was the first introduction in working with mobile application and in React Native. It was interesting and sligthly different from web development. Although React Native is similar to React it did came with some challenges, for instance when styling. Instead of using style component for fonts, I used inline styling. If I had more time I would like to fetch data from another api and try to do a multipage app. Overall, it was a fun project that could be built on.
